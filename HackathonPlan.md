## Plan

* Setup the Infrastructure for measurements
* Install the required softwares for measurements (EcoDNS, Scaphandre..)
* Verify the DNS traffic generation


## Expected Output
* Baseline measurements (With DNS over UDP)
  * Able to have the overall measurements of DNS energy consumption (i.e. BIND9) in Grafana in kWh
    * Compare the software & hardware measurements for the above scenario 
  * Measure the energy consumption for the baseline scenarion with respect to HW (e.g. CPU, GPU, Network Interface)
* Repeat the measurements made in baseline with DoT, DoH
