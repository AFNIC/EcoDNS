To have the infrastructure as mentioned in the [Architecture](https://github.com/AFNIC/EcoDNS/edit/main/Prerequisites.md), we need to have the following softwares installed: 
 * [BIND9 installation]
 * [Scaphandre installation]
 * [Ecofloc installation]
 * [Nethogs installation]
 * Grafana

### BIND9 installation

### Scaphandre installation
[Scaphandre](https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre) is a tool that makes it possible to measure the power being used by a single process on a computer/server.

### Ecofloc installation
[EcoFloc]( https://github.com/labDomolandes/ecofloc) calculates the energy consumption for each hardware component based on the load generated by running processes, identified by their *PID*.

### Nethogs installation




[BIND9 installation]: #bind9-installation
[Scaphandre installation]: #scaphandre-installation
[Ecofloc installation]: #ecofloc-installation
[Nethogs installation]: #nethogs-installation
